The client API provides us with following built in events:

    connect

    When the client successfully connects.
    connecting

    When the client is in process of connecting.
    disconnect

    When the client is disconnected
    connect_failed

    When connection to server fails
    error

    An error event is sent from the server
    message

    When server sends a message using the send function.
    reconnect

    When reconnection to server is successful.
    reconnecting

    When the client is in process of connecting.
    reconnect_failed

    When the reconnection attempt fails.
    

To handle errors, we can handle these events using out socket object that we created on our client. For example, if we have a connection that fails, we can use the following to connect to the server again:

socket.on('connect_failed', function() {
    document.write("Sorry, there seems to be an issue with the connection!");
})
